## <ins> **Abstract** </ins>

Create/train a Residual Convolutional Neural Network AI model that can take an image from a user, scan it, and accurately guess what animal it is as well as its specific species. The model will be trained on multiple animal image datasets to improve accuracy. We will also develop a web frontend interface/website where users can input images and the AI model will output its guess. If we have enough time, the website will also display an infographic about the inner workings of the model. The collection and preprocessing of the high quality image datasets will take up a large amount of time. Trying to maintain high prediction accuracy across multiple animals and species will be difficult. Connecting the AI-model to the web-based interface will also be a challenge. Since we can’t train our AI model on all the animals and their species due to time and processing power, we could narrow down the list to a reasonable amount of animals/species such as cats, dogs, birds, and lizards. To maintain accuracy, we will tune our model with selected datasets based on the previously mentioned animals instead of using generalized datasets.
