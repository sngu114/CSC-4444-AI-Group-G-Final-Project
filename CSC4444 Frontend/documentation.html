      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Our project aims to create and train a <strong>Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet)</strong> that can
        take an uploaded image, analyze it, and accurately identify both the animal and its specific species.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model will be trained using multiple curated animal image datasets to improve classification accuracy.
        Alongside this, we will build a <strong>web-based frontend interface</strong> where users can upload images and
        instantly receive the model’s predictions. If time allows, we’ll include an interactive infographic explaining
        how the model processes and classifies images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Challenges include dataset collection and preprocessing, model tuning for high accuracy across multiple animal
        classes, and seamless integration between the AI model and frontend. Due to time and resource limits, we will
        focus on specific categories — cats, dogs, birds, and lizards — and fine-tune our model accordingly.
